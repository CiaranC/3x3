# 3x3 Game

A simple sequence game in the form of a 3x3 grid of uniquely coloured squares.

## Spec

Develop a simple sequence game in the form of a 3x3 grid of uniquely coloured squares. Underneath this grid you should have a start button and a score (initially set to zero). Clicking the start button should: disable the start button, choose five of these squares at random, and one by one animate their opacity slightly to denote a sequence to the user. At this point the user is then prompted via an on-screen message to attempt to copy the pattern just shown. Record the users clicks and test to see if they have followed the sequence correctly.

If successful, increment a score counter and show the user how many sequences in a row they have completed.

If unsuccessful, alert the user that the sequence was incorrect and reset their score counter to zero. Win or lose, the start button should then be re-enabled for another round. This mini-project should highlight your skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

###Audio

All audio samples were created in Logic Studio pro. The 9 tones used form the D Phrygian mode. I've done this because modes work best when triggering random tones. It can even almost sound song-like if you get your timing right!
